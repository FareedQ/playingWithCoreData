# playingWithCoreData

This is a project to play around with core data, where I store and retrieve some information. Playing with relations and manipulating set data.

Troubleshooting
-----------------
Had an issue once when compiling this, where it said 
```
Command /Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/clang failed with exit code 1
```

I resolved the issue by going to Project Settings > Under "Targets", select your project > Build Phases > open "Compile Sources" and "Copy Bundle Resources" removing all the files and then reloading it.

If you experince any other issues, please put it in the "Issues" here in github and I'll get back to you ASAP.

Thanks,
Fareed
